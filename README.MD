YouTube redirect tracking remover
===

When you click on a link in a YouTube videos description YouTube does not directly redirect you to the target site.
Instead they redirect you to a page where they can track your clicking activities and auto-redirect you to the destination page.
This extension fixes that behavior by sending you to the destination site directly.
